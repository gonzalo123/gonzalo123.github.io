Server side web frameworks are dead. Long life to client side web frameworks. Struts, JSF, Spring, Ruby on Rails, Cake, Symfony ... (even my framework in PHP ;) ) as full stack web framework are dead. Logic is moving to the client side. Javascript, the language used as deadly weapon in the [browser wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) nowadays is the key of the web. Server logic is getting thin. A thin server side framework serving JSON (Zend Framework is really cool for this) plus a good and strong client side framework such as Dojo or ExtJs with a good widget set with all the application logic can be the new parading of web develop.

A must-see speech about web tendencies about this idea:
