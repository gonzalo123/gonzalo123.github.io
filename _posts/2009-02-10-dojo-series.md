I will start a new series of posts based on my experiences learning [Dojo](www.dojotoolkit.org/). This is not a tutorial of Dojo. Those posts want to help me to get new skills. The learning of Dojo is a bit frustrating sometimes. When you have written a dozens of source code and you realized all its wrong and that isn't the Dojo way of doing this and you need to rewrite all. But you feel really happy when your widget appear on the browser. I have in my mind some post-project now and I hope I will post them soon
