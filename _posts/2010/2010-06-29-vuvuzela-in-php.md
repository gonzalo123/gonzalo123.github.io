South Africaâ€™s World Cup is here. Someone will win. We will remember goals, players, mistakes but definitely we will remember the sound of this world cup. The annoying vuvuzela. There're filters to avoid this sound in the matches. And here is my personal contribution to the word cup. A vuvuzela in PHP. A standalone single php script with a mp3 Embedded inside. Put it in your server and enjoy with the sound.
