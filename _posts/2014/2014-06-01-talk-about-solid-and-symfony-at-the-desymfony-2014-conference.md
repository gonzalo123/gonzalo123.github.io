Last saturday I attended to the [deSymfony](http://day.desymfony.com/) conference in Barcelona. A great opportunity to meet again with the PHP and Symfony community in Spain. This year the conference accepted my talk about SOLID and Symfony. Here you can see the slides of the talk (slides in spanish): [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/gonzaloayuso/solid-and-symfony-desymfonyday-2014)

The conference was perfect. Barcelona is an incredible city and the conference place (10 minutes walking from the Sagrada Familia), was incredible too. Great talks. But the best, as always, the coffe breaks with the conversations with the Symfony and PHP community from Valencia, Zaragoza, Madrid, Barcelona, ...

That's me in action speaking about SOLID 

principles and Symfony:

But the best of my speech was in the opposite direction. Many thanks to all of you :)
