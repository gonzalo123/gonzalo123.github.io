As a web developer firefox is my only choice. I need other browser to test my applications but I can't live without firebug. I now there are other firebug-clone for other browsers but firebug is the number one.

But normally I have a console ready to type

> killall firefox-bin

It's really cool when one tab of your firefox becomes crazy and all firefox instance dies.Next generation of browsers will solve this problem. But at least now Chrome is not ready under Linux.

What can I do?, Only Cry? ;)
