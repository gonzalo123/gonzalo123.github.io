Today I want to play a little bit with Python and threads. This kind of post are one kind of cheat sheet that I like to publish, basically to remember how do do things.

I don't like to use threads. They are very powerful but, as uncle Ben said: Great power comes great responsibility. I prefer decouple process with queues instead using threads, but sometimes I need to use them. Let's start

First I will build a simple script without threads. This script will append three numbers (1, 2 and 3) to a list and it will sum them. The function that append numbers to the list sleeps a number of seconds equals to the number that we're appending.

```python
import time
 
start_time = time.time()
 
total = []
 
 
def sleeper(seconds):
    time.sleep(seconds)
    total.append(seconds)
 
 
for s in (1, 2, 3):
    sleeper(s)
 
end_time = time.time()
 
total_time = end_time - start_time
 
print("Total time: {:.3} seconds. Sum: {}".format(total_time, sum(total)))
```

The the outcome of the script is obviously 6 (1 + 2 + 3) and as we're sleeping the script a number of seconds equals to the the number that we're appending our script, it takes 6 seconds to finish.

Now we're going to use a threading version of the script. We're going to do the same, but we're going to use one thread for each append (with the same sleep function)

```python
import time
from queue import Queue
import threading
 
start_time = time.time()
 
queue = Queue()
 
 
def sleeper(seconds):
    time.sleep(seconds)
    queue.put(seconds)
 
 
threads = []
for s in (1, 2, 3):
    t = threading.Thread(target=sleeper, args=(s,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
 
for one_thread in threads:
    one_thread.join()
 
total = 0
while not queue.empty():
    total = total + queue.get()
 
end_time = time.time()
 
total_time = end_time - start_time
print("Total time: {:.3} seconds. Sum: {}".format(total_time, total))
```

The outcome of our script is 6 again, but now it takes 3 seconds (the highest sleep).
