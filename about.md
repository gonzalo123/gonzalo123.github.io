* **Technical reviewer**

**Do you have a book or paper, and you need a technical reviewer?** I’m an active technical book reader. I also participated in a couple of technical reviews in the past and I really enjoy the experience so much, so I’m open to be a technical reviewer for you.

You can see more or less my skills her but basically my interest are: **Back-end** technologies, **Databases**, **Linux** and also **Front-end** stuff with JavaScript. My primer languages are **PHP**, **Python** and **JavaScript**. I’m also open to other languages such as **Java**, **Ruby**, **C#** (I enjoy programming. Language is just a tool).

My experiences as a technical reviewer are:

* CouchDB and PHP Web Development (Packt Publishing) [link](https://www.packtpub.com/product/couchdb-and-php-web-development-beginner-s-guide/9781849513586)
