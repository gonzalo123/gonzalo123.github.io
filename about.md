* **Technical reviewer**

**Do you have a book or paper and you need a technical reviewer?** I’m an active technical book reader. I also participated in a couple of technical reviews in the past and I really enjoy the experience so much, so I’m open to be a technical reviewer for you.

You can see more or less my skills her but basically my interest are: **Back-end** technologies, **Databases**, **Linux** and also **Front-end** stuff with JavaScript. My primer languages are **PHP**, **Python** and **JavaScript**. I’m also open to other languages such as **Java**, **Ruby**, **C#** (I enjoy programming. Language is just a tool).

You also can find me in: GitHub, Twitter and Linkedin.
