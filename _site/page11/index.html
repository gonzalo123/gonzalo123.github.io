            </h2>
            <p class="excerpt">One of the problems I need to solve in my clustered PHP applications is where to store files. When I say files I’m not speaking about source code. I’m speaking about additional data files, such as download-able pdfs, logs, etc. Those files must be on every node of the cluster. One possible approach to the solution is to use a distributed filesystem, rsync or maybe use a file-server mounted on every node. Another solution may be the usage of CouchDb. CouchDb has two great features to meet or requirements with this problem. It allows us to store files as attachments and it also allows to perform a great and very easy multi-master replica system.

            </h2>
            <p class="excerpt">Maybe there’re people who write code without bugs and never need to change one line of their source code. That’s not me. I try to improve my coding skill for the years. That means sometimes I need to face against my old code and if need to rewrite it probably I will do in a different way. I always feel the desire to refactor it. Refactor code is a good thing but is not always viable.Let’s show an example. Nowadays I’ve embraced Zend coding standard. For instance one not camelized variable creeps me out. But in my early days as a PHP developer (almost ten years ago) I didn’t take care about any coding standards. If code worked, it was OK. Now I realized that’s not enough. Code must work. Indeed!. But it must be ready to be changed, adapted to new needs and meet new requirements, and another developer must be able to understand it. Last days before holidays I’ve been working adapting a project to PHP5.3. It’s not a hard job. Some functions have disappeared, now we only have one kind of regular expressions and a couple of things more. I need to check a lot of lines of code. Sometimes I blush myself when I see the code I wrote five or even eight years ago. I want to change a lot of things. Refactor again and again but I must remember that’s not in the scope of the project. The objective of the project is clear: The application must work in a server with PHP5.3. If I start to refactor code the project deviates from project’s main scope. That’s a clear scope creep’s signal.

            </h2>
            <p class="excerpt">I’ve been working wih my first project using namenspaces in PHP. As a PHP developer I have been suffering the lack of a program language without namespaces for years. But now it’s over. Finally we have namespaces in PHP since PHP 5.3. My early impressions wasn’t good. I had a problem. I really liked PEAR naming conventions. I know that leads to those ugly long class names, but I felt very comfortable with them. I even started to write a post in my blog called “Things I don’t like in PHP. Namespaces”. But I decided not to publish it since have been working a bit seriously with them. Now I have use them and my impressions have been changed. I’ve embraced them and they are not so bad. They have the same advantages than PEAR naming conventions and they give us some extra benefits further. Here we have a great article about namenspaces in PHP5.3

Maybe more than a list of ideas is a list of problems that you will face when swapping from a standalone server to a clustered server.

This process is very simple. Basically is a PHP script who looks the modification date of a file. When it changes, the script ends but if nothing happens the script ends after 30 seconds and start again (with a JavaScript loop). The script worked perfectly on sandbox. In production also worked (brilliant isn’t it?). But the problem appears when I open other tabs in the browser. The application became slow. Very slow. Every click, even really simple operations turned into unusable operations. I realized this behavior appear only when comet was enabled.

It’s not very dificult to handle pivot tables by hand but the work is always the same: groups by, totals, subtotals, totals per row …. Now I want to write a class to pivot tables in PHP with the most common requirements (at least for me). I know we can create pivot tables with SQL. Group by and some other database specific commands like oracle’s GROUP BY ROLLUP/CUBE can do the work, but I like clean SQL querys. The business logic must be in PHP and SQL must be as clean as we can.
