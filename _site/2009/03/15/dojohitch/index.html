  <section class="post">
    <p>The first time I read about <em>dojo.hitch</em> I didn’t understand anything. I read in a book <em>dojo.hitch</em> is a very important function and widely used into dojo library but I didn’t understand why. I am using my learning of dojo to improve my skill in javascript. I remember the time when I hate javascript. I thought it was a very poor program language and everything I need to do with js was a nightmare. If browser was Netscape one way to to do one thing, if browser was IE other (of a other and a couple of hacks). But the times have changed. XHR and Ajax has reinvented the web. Web pages had became into Web Applications. Asynchronous request had opened our minds to a new generation of web applications, and all of it is thanks to javascript. Each day I spent learning js I see how much I was wrong.</p>

<p>Javascript literals are really powerful but the concept of scope is strange when you come from POO. <em>this.foo</em> in js sounds like <em>$this-&gt;foo</em> in PHP but its not the same.</p>

<p>For example in the following example:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">dojo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">declare</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">gam.desktop</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">variable1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">foo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">dojo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">xhrPost</span><span class="p">({</span>
            <span class="na">url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">myUrl</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="na">load</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">responseObject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">ioArgs</span><span class="p">){</span>
                <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">variable1</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="p">}),</span>
            <span class="na">handleAs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">json</span><span class="dl">"</span>
        <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>console.log(this.variable1); will not display 1 in firebug console. Its strange for me when I started with dojo. The problem is that here this points to the scope of the function foo and not to the scope of class gam.desktop. You can do strange tricky-hacks to solve the problem with global variables or something like that, or use dojo.hitch.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">dojo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">declare</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">gam.desktop</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">variable1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">foo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">dojo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">xhrPost</span><span class="p">({</span>
            <span class="na">url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">myUrl</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="na">load</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">dojo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hitch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">responseObject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">ioArgs</span><span class="p">){</span>
                <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">variable1</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="p">}),</span>
            <span class="na">handleAs</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">json</span><span class="dl">"</span>
        <span class="p">}));</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>elegant isn’t it?</p>
